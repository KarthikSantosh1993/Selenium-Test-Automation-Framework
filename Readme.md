**Running Tests on chrome browser on Local machine in headless mode:**

```bash
  mvn test -Dbrowser=chrome -Dislambda=false -Disheadless=true -X
```
 

**Running Tests on LambdaTest:**

```bash
  mvn test -Dbrowser=chrome -Dislambda=true -Disheadless=false -X
```
 
## Logs and Reports

**Logs:** Logs are created during test execution and stored in logs/ directory)

**Test Reports:** After the execution, detailed report will be generated in ./report.html 

The report contains information on test cases executed. Status of each test case - pass, failed, skipped along with screenshots for failed Tests


## Git hub Actions Integration 

- This automation framework is integrated with github actions. 
- The tests will be executed at 06:00PM CST every day
